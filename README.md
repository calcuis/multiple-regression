# multiple-regression
an example of a Python function that performs multiple regression analysis

```
import numpy as np

def multiple_regression(X, y):
    # Add a column of ones to X to account for the bias term
    X = np.column_stack((np.ones(X.shape[0]), X))

    # Compute the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of X
    X_pinv = np.linalg.pinv(X)

    # Compute the coefficients of the regression model
    coef = X_pinv.dot(y)

    return coef
```

This function takes in two arguments: `X` and `y`, which are the input features and the target variable, respectively. It uses the pseudoinverse of `X` to compute the coefficients of the multiple regression model.

To use this function, you would call it like this:
```
# Assume X is a n x p matrix of input features
# and y is a n x 1 vector of target values

coef = multiple_regression(X, y)
```

This would compute the coefficients of the multiple regression model and store them in the `coef` variable. You could then use the coefficients to make predictions on new data.
